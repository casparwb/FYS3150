# FYS3150

### Project 1
 Getting to know various numerical vector- and matrix operations by solving the one-dimensional Poisson-equation.

### Project 2
 Studying different approaches to eigenvalue problems by looking at the equations of a buckling beam and Schroedinger's equation for two electrons in a 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator well.

### Project 3
 Comparing different methods for approximating integrals, namely various variants of Gaussian Quadrature and Monte Carlo methods, by looking at a six-dimensional integral derived from the correlation energy between two electrons repelling each other via the Coloumb interaction.

### Project 4
 A numerical study of the phase transitions of the 2-dimensional Ising model using Monte Carlo methods with Metropolis-Hastings sampling.

###Project 5
 A Monte Carlo approach to the simulation of the spread of an infectious disease using the SIRS model.

All projects written in the Julia programming language, with the exception of some code written in C for the sake of parallelization.
