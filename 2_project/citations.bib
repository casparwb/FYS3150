@article{Ermentrout1989,
abstract = {SUMMARY: The example books published as part of the Numerical Recipes second edition series contain source programs that exercise and demonstrate all of the Numerical Recipes subroutines. Each example program contains comments and is prefaced by a short description of what it does. The books contain all of the old material from the original edition as well as new material from the second edition. They will be valuable for readers who wish to incorporate procedures and subroutines into their own source programs. They are available in both FORTRAN and C.},

@article{Cullum2002,
abstract = {First published in 1985, this book presents background material, descriptions, and supporting theory relating to practical numerical algorithms for the solution of huge eigenvalue problems. This book deals with 'symmetric' problems. However, in this book, 'symmetric' also encompasses numerical procedures for computing singular values and vectors of real rectangular matrices and numerical procedures for computing eigenelements of nondefective complex symmetric matrices. Although preserving orthogonality has been the golden rule in linear algebra, most of the algorithms in this book conform to that rule only locally, resulting in markedly reduced memory requirements. Additionally, most of the algorithms discussed separate the eigenvalue (singular value) computations from the corresponding eigenvector (singular vector) computations. This separation prevents losses in accuracy that can occur in methods which, in order to be able to compute further into the spectrum, use successive implicit deflation by computed eigenvector or singular vector approximations.},
